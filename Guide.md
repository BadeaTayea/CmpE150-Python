1. Configuring the default Python Interpreter (https://youtu.be/9Ou3WvXMQQU)

   This video explains how to **configure your default Python Interpreter**. You must only do this once, and the default interpreter will be determined for all projects you create, and all Quizzes you take. **If you don't perform this before your Quiz**, your code may be interpreted by a different version of Python in your computer, and **you may not get a full grade**. Please make sure that you set your default Python interpreter as Python 3.8.6 (location may differ in different systems, refer to the *Create a new project* section in the [Installation Guide](Installation%20Guide.pdf).

## Quiz Reminders <a name="quiz-reminder"></a>

1. During the Quiz, **do not delete the comments provided in Main.py**. **Write your code between them.**
2. Please, **do not print things like "The result is: ", "Enter an integer:", "Area is: " etc.** You should only print the output listed in the examples. If the output that is expected for the input 2 is 1.0, just print that number. Otherwise, **your extra prints will cause you to get a grade of zero** from that question.
